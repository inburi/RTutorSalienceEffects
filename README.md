This is an RTutor problem set which has the goal to help the user to
reproduce and understand the results of the research paper "Automatic Bill Payments
and Salience Effects: Evidence from Electricity Consumption" by Steven Sexton which can
be downloaded at 'http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/REST_a_00465'.

To run the problem set place 'SalienceEffects_sol.Rmd' and the '.dta' files in the same
directory, open 'SalienceEffect_Sol.Rmd' in RStudio, change the path in the function
setwd("C:/...") at the beginning of the file in the ignore block(everything in between
'#< ignore' and '#>') to the path of the directory where you put the files and press Ctrl-Alt-R. 
The problem set will be launched in the browser.
